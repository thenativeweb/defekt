## Installation

```shell
$ npm install defekt
```

## Quick start

First you need to add a reference to defekt in your application:

```javascript
const defekt = require('defekt').default;
```

If you use TypeScript, use the following code instead:

```typescript
import defekt from 'defekt';
```

Then call the `defekt` function and hand over an object of custom error configurations that you would like to have created:

```javascript
const errors = defekt({
  ArgumentNull: {},
  InvalidOperation: {},
  // name: config
});
```

The result is an object containing all the errors you specified. To use one of those errors, simply call the appropriate function with `new` and throw it:

```javascript
throw new errors.InvalidOperation();
```

By default, the error name is also used as the error message, but converted to a human readable form. E.g., the error name `InvalidOperation` becomes the message `Invalid operation.`:

```javascript
try {
  throw new errors.InvalidOperation();
} catch (ex) {
  console.log(ex.message);
  // => 'Invalid operation.'
}
```

If you want to specify a custom message, feel free to do so:

```javascript
throw new errors.InvalidOperation('Something failed.');
```

Additionally, if an error was caused by another error, you can specify this error as the second parameter:

```javascript
throw new errors.InvalidOperation('Something failed.', new Error(...));
```

The custom errors follow the same rules as the built-in ones, i.e. they have a `name` and a `message` property, they derive from `Error` and they can be recognized by the `util.isError` function.

### Defining error codes

By default, each custom error uses its uppercased name with an `E` prefix as error code. E.g., an `InvalidOperation` error uses `EINVALIDOPERATION` as its code.

From time to time, you may want to provide custom error codes. For that specify a `code` property on the configuration objects:

```javascript
const errors = defekt({
  ArgumentNull: { code: 'ARGNULL' },
  InvalidOperation: { code: 'INVALOP' },
  ...: { code: '...' }
});
```
